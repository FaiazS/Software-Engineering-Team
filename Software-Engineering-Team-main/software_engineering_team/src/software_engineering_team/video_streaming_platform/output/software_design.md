# Video Streaming Platform Software Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the microservices architecture for a video streaming platform that allows users to sign up for an account, record, upload and share videos, like/dislike, comment on videos, and provides in-house editing tools. The architecture is based on **SOLID principles** and incorporates **industry-standard design patterns** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and robustness.

## Microservices Breakdown

### 1. User Service
- **Purpose:** Manages user accounts, authentication, and profile settings.
- **Classes:**
  - **User:** Represents a user in the system.
    - **Methods:** `register()`, `login()`, `updateProfile()`, `deleteAccount()`
  - **Authentication:** Handles user authentication.
    - **Methods:** `validateCredentials()`, `generateToken()`, `invalidateToken()`
- **Interactions:** 
  - Communicates with the `Video Service` to fetch user-related video data.

### 2. Video Service
- **Purpose:** Manages video recording, uploading, sharing, and interactions (like/dislike, commenting).
- **Classes:**
  - **Video:** Represents a video entity.
    - **Methods:** `upload()`, `share()`, `like()`, `dislike()`, `addComment()`
  - **VideoFactory:** Implements the Factory Pattern for creating video objects.
    - **Methods:** `createVideo()`
  - **Comment:** Represents the comment entity.
    - **Methods:** `addComment()`, `deleteComment()`
- **Interactions:** 
  - Uses the `User Service` to validate the identity of the user performing actions on videos.
  - Integrates with the `Editing Service` to facilitate video processing.

### 3. Editing Service
- **Purpose:** Provides in-house video editing tools for users to edit their videos.
- **Classes:**
  - **VideoEditor:** Implements editing functionalities.
    - **Methods:** `trim()`, `addFilter()`, `addAudio()`
  - **EditingStrategy:** Implements the Strategy Pattern to choose different editing strategies (e.g., different editing effects).
    - **Methods:** `applyEditing()`
- **Interactions:**
  - Receives video data from the `Video Service` for editing operations.
  - Sends edited video back to the `Video Service`.

### 4. Notification Service
- **Purpose:** Manages notifications (e.g., activity alerts, comments on videos).
- **Classes:**
  - **Notification:** Represents a notification.
    - **Methods:** `sendCommentNotification()`, `sendLikeNotification()`
  - **Observer:** Implements the Observer Pattern to notify users about comments and likes.
    - **Methods:** `addObserver()`, `notifyObservers()`
- **Interactions:**
  - Listens for events from the `Video Service` and sends notifications to users.

### 5. Integration Service
- **Purpose:** Handles sharing videos to external sites.
- **Classes:**
  - **ExternalServiceAdapter:** Implements the Adapter Pattern for external services (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo).
    - **Methods:** `shareToService()`
- **Interactions:**
  - Works with the `Video Service` to access the video data for sharing.

## API Interactions
Each service will expose RESTful APIs for inter-service communication. Below are the simplified API endpoints:

### User Service API
- `POST /api/users/register` - Register a new user.
- `POST /api/users/login` - User login.
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile.

### Video Service API
- `POST /api/videos/upload` - Upload a video.
- `GET /api/videos/:id` - Get video details.
- `POST /api/videos/:id/like` - Like a video.
- `POST /api/videos/:id/dislike` - Dislike a video.
- `POST /api/videos/:id/comments` - Add a comment to a video.

### Editing Service API
- `POST /api/videos/:id/edit` - Edit a video.

### Notification Service API
- `POST /api/notifications` - Send a notification.

### Integration Service API
- `POST /api/integration/share` - Share video to an external service.

## Data Flow
1. **User registers** on the User Service and receives an authentication token.
2. **User uploads a video** through the Video Service which interacts with the User Service to verify the user.
3. **The user can edit the video** using the Editing Service, which processes the video and returns the edited version.
4. **Comments and likes** are managed through the Video Service, which publishes events to the Notification Service.
5. **Users can share videos** through the Integration Service, which formats the request and interacts with the appropriate external API.

## Design Rationale and Trade-offs
- **Modularity:** Each service has a well-defined purpose, allowing teams to work independently.
- **Separation of Concerns:** By isolating functionalities into services, we achieve easier maintenance and troubleshooting.
- **Extensibility:** The use of design patterns like Factory and Strategy provides flexibility for future features such as new video effects or additional external services.
- **Scalability:** Microservices architecture enables horizontal scaling, allowing services to handle increasing loads without affecting others.

This design framework provides a solid foundation upon which to build the backend of the video streaming platform while adhering to best practices in software engineering.
